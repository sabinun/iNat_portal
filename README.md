"# iNat_portal" 
In my youth I studied life sciences.
In 1969 I started working as a programmer in Assembler, 
later in Kobol and from 1985 I programmed in SAS. 
In 2016 I retired.

As a retiree, I dedicate my time in three areas: 
  -  listening to lectures in various fields, 
  -  programming in SAS for private needs, 
  -  nature walks while photographing plants, birds and landscapes.

I recently confessed to the israel.inaturalist.org website in the Hebrew version, 
I uploaded photos from the animal and plant world, while trying to reach as taxonomic a definition as possible. 
Next I copied the views from the site to an Excel file and 
with the help of SAS I developed HTML code and 
built a portal of the uploaded images to above site, 
which allows access to images in different sections.

I intend to upload this portal to GIT and 
distribute a viewing link to acquaintances.
